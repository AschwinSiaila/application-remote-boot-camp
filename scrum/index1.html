    <h2>History of scrum</h2>
        <p>Scrum was introduced in a study by Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi, published in the Harvard Business Review in early 1986. This research describes that projects with small (multidisciplinary) teams historically deliver the best results. As a result of this research, Jeff Sutherland developed the scrum process in 1993, while Ken Schwaber applied his own approach to his company. Together they elaborated this further and in 1995 Ken Schwaber formalized scrum as a software development method. Scrum was developed in the US and is often used in partly English-language projects, hence the English terminology.</p>
    <h2>Meaning of scrum</h2>
        <p>Scrum is a framework to create (software) products in a flexible way. We work in multidisciplinary teams that deliver working (software) products in short sprints, with a fixed length of 1 to 4 weeks. Scrum is a term that comes from rugby. At a scrum, a team tries to achieve a goal together and win the game. Cooperation is very important and we must be able to respond quickly to changing circumstances.
        Scrum is often used for products where the customer or user does not yet know what he wants and where one learns to better describe the requirements and wishes and convert them into usable products. Often people only know what they want when they see the first product, the prototype,and then the requirements are adjusted. Scrum has the flexibility to deal with late changing requirements and wishes. Scrum is part of agile software development.</p>
    <h2>Assumptions of scrum</h2>
        <p><span>dedication:</span> the members must make a full commitment to it; It's not a part-time job.</p>
        <p><span>focus:</span> one has to focus on what needs to be done in the sprints.</p>
        <p><span>transparency:</span> we must keep each other well informed about progress and possible problems.</p>
        <p><span>respect:</span> one must respect people from different backgrounds and expertise.</p>
        <p> <span>guts:</span>one must have the courage to name things, ask questions and come up with new solutions.</p>

  <li>Knowledge arises from experience and making decisions based on what is known. The fundament to implement this is transparency, inspection and adjustment</li>
